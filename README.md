# ELT Schedule Management System

## Introduction

The ELT Schedule Management System is designed to streamline and automate the management and execution of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs. These jobs are essential in data processing pipelines, where data is extracted from various sources, transformed into the required format, and loaded into a target database or data warehouse. The system enhances the efficiency, reliability, and manageability of these processes.

## Features

- **Automate ETL Processes**: Schedule and execute ETL jobs automatically to ensure consistent data updates.
- **Efficient Job Management**: Create, configure, and manage ETL jobs and tasks, ensuring organized workflows.
- **Kafka Integration**: Utilize Kafka for reliable task communication and coordination.
- **Flexible Execution**: Support both manual and automatic job execution.
- **Job Monitoring and Logging**: Maintain detailed logs for monitoring, troubleshooting, and ensuring data integrity.
- **User Control**: Run, skip, or cancel jobs as needed.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: Handle large data volumes and concurrent users with high availability.
- **Security and Compliance**: Enforce user authentication and role-based access control.
- **Enhanced Data Quality**: Ensure regular, reliable data updates.
- **Simplify Complex Workflows**: User-friendly interface for configuring and linking tasks.

## System Overview

### Architecture

1. **Frontend (Angular)**: User interface for job management and monitoring.
2. **Backend (Java, Spring Boot)**: Business logic, task management with Kafka, database interactions.
3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Storage for users, jobs, tasks, logs, schedules.

### Key Components

- **User Interface**: Dashboard, Job Management, Task Configuration, Logs.
- **Job Scheduler**: Manual and automatic job execution.
- **Task Manager**: Task configuration and linking using Kafka.
- **Job Execution and Monitoring**: Real-time job monitoring, detailed logging.
- **User Management**: Role-based access control, user profiles.

### Functionalities

- Create and manage ETL jobs.
- Configure source tasks with Kafka.
- Schedule jobs for automatic or manual execution.
- Monitor jobs and maintain logs.
- User control to run, skip, or cancel jobs.
